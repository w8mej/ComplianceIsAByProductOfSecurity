Before granting access to the system, The BlackBerry UEM 12.7 server/server platform is required to display the DoD-approved system use notification message or banner that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This ensures the legal requirements for auditing and monitoring are met.

The approved DoD text must be used as specified in the KS referenced in DoDI 8500.01.

The non-bracketed text below must be used without any changes as the warning banner. 

[A. Use this banner for desktops, laptops, and other devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters. The banner shall be implemented as a click-through banner at logon (to the extent permitted by the operating system), meaning it prevents further activity on the information system unless and until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating “OK.”]

- Server primary administrator: Responsible for server installation, initial configuration, and maintenance functions. Responsible for the setup and maintenance of security configuration administrator and auditor accounts. Responsible for the maintenance of applications in the MAS. (Called "Security Administrator" in UEM)

Using the procedures below:
- Assign at least one user to the UEM Security Administrator role. Few administrators should be assigned to this role. 
Note: UEM automatically restricts the following functions to only the Security Administrator: Full permissions to manage the BlackBerry Enterprise Solution. Capability to create and edit roles.
- Define an "Auditor" role (see the VulDiscussion for role functions). Assign at least one user (UEM administrator) to the role. The role should include only the following UEM permissions:
- View audit information
- Delete BlackBerry Dynamics audit log files
- View and export BlackBerry Dynamics audit log files
- View audit settings
- Edit audit settings and purge data
- Edit logging settings
- Define a site custom administrator roles or UEM predefined enterprise/help desk roles as needed to administer device policies and user accounts (for example, see the Security Configuration Administrator and Device User Group Administrator in the VulDiscussion). Assign users to the roles, as required. These roles should be used for day-to-day management of user accounts, group accounts, and profiles.

To set up specific roles, do the following:
1. Select "roles" in the left pane.
2. Select "add a role" on the top right.
3. Assign appropriate name and functions to the role. 
4. Click "Save".

To assign users or groups to a role, do the following:
1. Log in to the BlackBerry UEM 12.7 console and select the "Settings” tab at the top of the screen.
2. Expand the General settings tab on the left pane.
3. Expand the Administrators tab on the left pane.

To assign a role to a user:
1. Click "Users".
2. Click the "Add an administrator icon" (upper right corner).
3. If necessary, search for a user account.
4. Click the name of the user account.

Note: The exact name of the role is not important. Each role should include functions close to the role descriptions listed in the VulDiscussion.

Note: The intent of the requirement is that there be separate people performing each administrator role; few users are assigned to the UEM Security Administrator role; the auditor role is limited to only authorized permissions; and day-to-day management of user accounts, group accounts, and profiles are performed from site specific custom administrator roles or UEM predefined enterprise/help desk roles instead of the UEM Security Administrator.

3. Expand the Administrators tab on the left pane.
4. Select the Roles tab on the left pane.
5. Verify there is at least one user assigned to each of the following roles:

a. UEM Security Administrator
b. Auditor
c. One or more Site Custom Administrator or UEM predefined enterprise/help desk roles

Verify the auditor role function is limited to only reviewing and maintaining server and mobile device audit logs as follows:
1. Log in to the BlackBerry UEM 12.7 console and select the "Settings” tab at the top of the screen.
2. Expand the Administrators tab on the left pane.
3. Select the Roles tab on the left pane.
4. Click on the Auditor role.
5. Verify the role only has the following permissions assigned:
- View audit information
- Delete BlackBerry Dynamics audit log files
- View and export BlackBerry Dynamics audit log files
- View audit settings
- Edit audit settings and purge data
- Edit logging settings

Talk to the UEM Security Administrator and verify custom administrator roles / UEM predefined enterprise/help desk roles are used for day-to-day management of user accounts, group accounts, and profiles.

If at least one user is not associated with the UEM Security Administrator, Auditor, and one or more site custom administrator roles/UEM predefined enterprise/help desk roles, this is a finding.

If the auditor role has more permissions than authorized, this is a finding.

1. Log in to the BlackBerry UEM 12.7 host server and use the Windows Server ADSI Edit tool to add the following SPNs for BES12 to the Microsoft Active Directory account:
- HTTP/&lt;host_FQDN_or_pool_name&gt; (for example, HTTP/domain123.example.com)
- BASPLUGIN111/&lt;host_FQDN_or_pool_name&gt; (for example, BASPLUGIN111/domain123.example.com)
Note:
- If you configured high availability for the management consoles in a UEM domain, specify the pool name. Otherwise, specify the FQDN of the computer that hosts the management console.
- Verify that no other accounts in the Microsoft Active Directory forest have the same SPNs.
2. Open Microsoft Active Directory Users and Computers.
3. In the Microsoft Active Directory account properties, on the "Delegation" tab, select the following options:
- Trust this user for delegation to specified services only
- Use Kerberos only
4. Add the SPNs from step 1 to the list of services.

Configure single sign-on for UEM:
Note: 
- When you configure single sign-on for UEM, you configure it for the management console and UEM Self-Service.
- If you enable single sign-on for multiple Microsoft Active Directory connections, verify that there are no trust relationships between the Microsoft Active Directory forests.

7. Verify that the devices listed in the "Allowed device models" field match the list provided by the administrator.

If the "Allow selected device models" is not displayed in the "Device model restrictions" field or the devices listed in the "Allowed device models" field do not match the list provided by the administrator, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-78453"><title>PP-MDM-311047</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-93159r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>BUEM-12-007700</version><title>The BlackBerry UEM 12.7 server or platform must be configured to initiate a session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user (a MDM system administrator) stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their application session prior to vacating the vicinity, applications need to be able to identify when a user's application session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled. This is typically at the operating system level and results in a system lock but may be at the application level where the application interface window is secured instead.
